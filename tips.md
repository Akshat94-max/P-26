Be sure that all of your ingredients are at room temperature before getting starting. Make sure to sift the dry ingredients to remove any lumps of cocoa powder. This will also help to keep the cake soft and light. I suggest creaming the butter and sugar together for about 4-5 minutes. Creaming the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy incorporates more air into your cake batter creating a softer, lighter cake. Alternate mixing the dry ingredients in three additions with the buttermilk, this will help to prevent over mixing the cake batter.
